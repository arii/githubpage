This tutorial will show you how to modify the html to embed your video.\r\n\r\n##Steps to add the video\r\n0. First create a github page for your repository. Go to your repository's settings and select \"Launch automatic page generator\".  Follow the instructions to create your page and familiarize yourself with markdown.\r\n1. Create your website with markdown and include a section for your video.  Publish the page.\r\n2. Upload your video to youtube.  Select the share option and choose embed video.  It should look like this:\r\n```\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/f5l8GA1PHm8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n```\r\n3. Check out the github pages branch of your repository (gh-pages).  Here's the code I used to check out this repository, \"githubpage\":\r\n```\r\ngit clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/arii/githubpage.git\r\n```\r\n4. Edit index.html with your favorite text editor.  Locate the video section and paste the iframe code from youtube.\r\n5. Commit and push your changes.\r\n```\r\ngit add index.html\r\ngit commit -m \"added video\"\r\ngit push \r\n```\r\n\r\n### My Embedded Video\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
